# Higher-Education-Institutions-in-Italy-Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of higher education institutions in Germany. This includes 400 higher education institutions in Germany, including universities,  universities of applied sciences and Higher Institutes as Higher Institute of Engineering, Higher Institute of biotechnologies and few others. This dataset was compiled in response to a cybersecurity investigation of Germany higher education institutions' websites [1]. The data is being made publicly available to promote open science principles [2].

## Data

The data includes the following fields for each institution:

- ETER_Id: A unique identifier assigned to each institution.
- Name: The full name of the institution.
- Category: Indicates whether the institution is public or private.
- Institution_Category_Standardized: Indicates whether the institution is University, University of applied sciences or other.
- Member_of_European_University_alliance: Indicates if the institution is member of European University Alliance (A kind of collaborative higher education institutions network in Europe).
- Url: The website of the institution.
- NUTS2: Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS): A classification by the European Union to divide member states' territories into statistical units. The NUTS system has three hierarchical levels, with NUTS2 being the second level.
- NUTS2_Label_2016: Refers to the classification of regions at the NUTS2 level according to the 2016 criteria set by the European Union.
- NUTS2_Label_2021: Refers to the classification of regions at the NUTS2 level according to the 2021 criteria set by the European Union.
- NUTS3: Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS): A classification by the European Union to divide member states' territories into statistical units. The NUTS system has three hierarchical levels, with NUTS3 being the third level.
- NUTS3_Label_2016: Refers to the classification of regions at the NUTS3 level according to the 2016 criteria set by the European Union.
- NUTS3_Label_2021: Refers to the classification of regions at the NUTS3 level according to the 2021 criteria set by the European Union.

## Methodology
The methodology for creating the dataset involved obtaining data from two sources: The European Higher Education Sector Observatory (ETER)[3]. The data was collected on December 26, 2024, the Eurostat for NUTS - Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2013-16[4] and 2021[5].

This section outlines the methodology used to create the dataset for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in France. The dataset consolidates information from various sources, processes the data, and enriches it to provide accurate and reliable insights.

**Data Sources**
1. **ETER Database**: The primary dataset was sourced from the ETER database, containing detailed information about HEIs in Europe.
   - File: `eter-export-2021-IT.xlsx`
2. **Eurostat NUTS Data**: Two datasets from Eurostat were used for regional information:
   - NUTS 2013-2016 regions: `NUTS2013-NUTS2016.xlsx`
   - NUTS 2021 regions: `NUTS2021.xlsx`

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
**Column Renaming**
Columns in the raw dataset were renamed for consistency and readability. Examples include:
- `ETER ID` → `ETER_ID`
- `Institution Name` → `Name`
- `Legal status` → `Category`

**Value Replacement**
1. **HEI Categories**: The `Category` column was cleaned, with government-dependent institutions classified as "public."
2. **Standardized Institution Categories**: Mapped numerical values to descriptive labels such as "University" and "University of applied sciences."
3. **European University Alliance Membership**: Replaced binary values with "Yes" or "No."

**Handling Missing or Incorrect Data**
1. Specific entries with missing or incorrect data were updated manually based on their `ETER_ID`. For instance:
   - Adjusted URLs for entries like `IT0162` (updated to `www.conspaganini.it`)
   - Adjusted URLs for entries like `IT0203` (updated to `www.conscremona.it`)
   - Remove URLs for entries like `IT0032`
   - Remove URLs for entries like `IT0178`

**Regional Data Integration**
1. Merged NUTS 2016 and NUTS 2021 data to enrich the dataset with regional labels.

**Final Dataset**
The final dataset was saved as a CSV file: `italy-heis.csv`, encoded in UTF-8 for compatibility. It includes detailed information about HEIs in France, their categories, regional affiliations, and membership in European alliances.

**Summary**
This methodology ensures that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and enriched with valuable regional and institutional details. The final dataset is intended to serve as a reliable resource for analyzing French HEIs.
